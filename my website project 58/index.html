My Journey-
<br>
So I was a 10 years when I started coding,Before Whitehat I was very much into tech and things related to wires,So from days I was trying to make an app but I didn't have a laptop so that I can make games,apps and websites/webpages and I found this website called code.whithatjr.com which was teaching codes so I discussed with my parent and finally they agreed with me and the trial class went awesome||So this is my journey of coding
